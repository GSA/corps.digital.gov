why: I love the idea of getting my foot in the door in government, having a cohort of likeminded individuals to help me launch my path, and getting to work for public good instead of the bottom line.
fun_fact: 'Kylie swam with 5 wild manatees in North Carolina! She was very careful not to touch them and learned that manatees are actually peaceful, big, and majestic. This experience changed her life.'

Kylie Hunter is a dynamic collaborator with an MS in Technology, Cybersecurity, and Policy from the University of Colorado Boulder, where her academic portfolio included research on human-AI social and romantic relationships, rootkits, and privacy-preserving platforms. 

As a solutions engineer at Salesforce since January, Kylie has leveraged her skills communicating value and navigating the intersection between technology and sales. With a strong background in software development and defensive cybersecurity, her passion for conflict resolution and facilitation means that she excels at strategizing and collaborating to tackle complex problems. Her passion for technology extends beyond the technical — she’s also deeply committed to ethical considerations, evident in her work on AI ethics and privacy-preserving platforms. Her experience includes roles at NIST and NIH. Known for her ability to present complex technical concepts clearly, Kylie is proud to serve the American people, bringing her skills and passion to make a positive impact as a civil servant at FedRAMP and USDC. 

In her free time, she volunteers for restorative justice facilitation and community mediation and likes to think of herself as a student of algorithms and society. Her friends know her as bubbly but grounded, and you can find her greeting every single dog she encounters, crocheting while listening to an audiobook or video essay, and bopping to literally any genre of music.

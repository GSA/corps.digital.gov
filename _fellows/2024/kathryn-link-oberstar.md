bio_short: Data scientist aspiring to make data accessible, understandable, and applicable for all public sector professionals, regardless of their background or domain expertise
why: "The public sector is filled with passionate, experienced, and dedicated professionals committed to serving the public. The right technological tools have the potential to profoundly amplify this work: reducing structural inefficiencies, minimizing friction between the public and the government in accessing services, and helping to identify where limited resources can have the biggest impact. I am excited to join the U.S. Digital Corps to help identify solutions that make it easier for people to access the services they need in an easy, intuitive, and dignified way."
fun_fact: "Kathryn has visited every single foreign embassy to the United States in Washington D.C."

why: Having the opportunity to work on high-impact projects at the scale of the federal level is a reward on its own—it’s not every day that someone is presented with these opportunities. By joining the U.S. Digital Corps, I have the potential to positively impact the lives of millions of Americans while growing my skills as a civic technologist!

Derek graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he studied Statistics and Digital Humanities. His combined interest in leveraging data to solve complex problems and in building satisfying, user-friendly products inspired him to pursue a career in product design. 

Prior to joining the U.S. Digital Corps, he served as a UI/UX Designer for an educational non-profit to build a digital library dedicated to helping families discover inclusive children’s books. He also designed full-time for an e-commerce company to launch new features and lead optimization initiatives to improve the customer experience.

In his free time, Derek enjoys testing new recipes, learning 3D modeling & rendering, caring for his cat Hotdog, and spending time with friends.

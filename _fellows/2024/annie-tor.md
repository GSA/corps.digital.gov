Annie is a graduate of Olin College, where she studied engineering and product design. She spends a lot of time thinking about technologists' responsibility for the consequences of what we build – an ongoing inquiry that she's looking forward to exploring further as a USDC Fellow. Before USDC, Annie worked for a network hardware startup, an arts nonprofit, a museum curator, and a train manufacturing company. Previous projects include designing and building a community education tool about the environmental impacts of wastewater systems, conducting air quality research to mobilize Boston residents around environmental justice, and coordinating product research and design for a machine learning application.

Annie loves to listen to experimental pop music, mess around in the kitchen, and knit impractical things. She grew up in the Bay Area and is always looking for horses, cool plants, and friends.

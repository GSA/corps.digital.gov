Emilia Schneider graduated from the University of Michigan with an M.S. in Information and a concentration in User Experience Research and Design. During her graduate program, she worked with two local governments on user experience projects that solidified her interest in civic tech. Prior to graduate work, Emilia was inspired to pursue UX while serving with an AmeriCorps State and National program and AmeriCorps VISTA for several years, during which she taught computer science summer school courses to 2nd-4th graders and founded a Girls Who Code club for middle schoolers. Outside of work, Emilia often reads about dog behavior and training, enjoys bird-watching and photography, and likes to occasionally learn more German and knit.

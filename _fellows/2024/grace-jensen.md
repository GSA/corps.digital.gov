Grace graduated from Georgetown University with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Data Science for Public Policy. Her professional experience includes several roles in the public sector, most recently as a graduate intern with the Federal Reserve Board. There, she helped onboard and maintain a wide portfolio of economic and financial data to support policy decisions. Prior to Georgetown, she received her Bachelors degree in Human and Organizational Development from Vanderbilt University.

Outside of work, she loves running and horrible reality television (recommendations are always appreciated)!

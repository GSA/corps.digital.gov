Tyler graduated from Binghamton University with a B.S. in Chemistry and a minor in Engineering. While seeming initially unrelated, he found various intersectionalities between the two such as the focus on complex systems, the incentive for experimentation, as well as the focus on analytics. As a result his academic journey involved a wide depth of subjects including programming, industrial systems and sustainable energy. His intersectional interests culminated in a Capstone Design project for a hydroelectric system where his focus was on design and integrated electronics.

Outside of academia, Tyler interned as a Business and Platform Analyst at a digital demand management firm dedicated to eliminating on-prem energy waste. He was able to work on his writing, platform testing, and analytics. Following his senior year, he went on a study abroad trip to Nepal where he installed a solar system in a local village in Pokhara.

Tyler grew up in Brooklyn, New York. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking, listening to a variety of podcasts, exploring interests in graphic design as well as language learning, and diving into various musical genres.

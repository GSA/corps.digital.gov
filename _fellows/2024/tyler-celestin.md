Tyler graduated from Binghamton University with a B.S. in Chemistry and a minor in Engineering. While initially interested in medicine, having the opportunity to participate in his universityâ€™s Smart Energy incubator served as a turning point for his undergraduate studies. He was able to listen to various guest speeches, tour labs, engage in discussions, and even give presentations around the field of engineering. As a result, his academic journey involved a wide range of subjects including programming, industrial systems, and sustainable energy. His interests culminated in a Capstone Design project for a hydroelectric system where his focus was on design and integrated electronics.

During his senior year, Tyler also interned as a business and platform analyst at a digital demand management firm dedicated to eliminating on-premise energy waste. While his primary responsibilities involved user experience and data analysis, he also authored reports on energy optimization and trading in the power market.

Following his senior year, Tyler participated in a study abroad program in Nepal, where he helped install a solar system in a local village in Pokhara.

Tyler grew up in Brooklyn, New York. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking, listening to a variety of podcasts, exploring graphic design, language learning, and diving into various musical genres.

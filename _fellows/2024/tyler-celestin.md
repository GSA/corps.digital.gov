Tyler graduated from Binghamton University with a B.S. in Chemistry. While at Binghamton, he worked as a Business and Platform Analyst at a digital demand management firm that tracks and eliminates on-premises energy waste. During his tenure there, he conducted A/B testing on their web and mobile interfaces and analyzed a number of data and demand response trends. Additionally, he authored reports and articles on energy optimization and future trends, such as the intersection of blockchain technology and energy trading. He parlayed his software experience to drive impact on his Capstone Design Team for a hydroelectric system. His use of open-source software provided targeted analytics.

After graduation and study abroad trips, he ended up pivoting into software through internships, programs, and fellowships. Following his undergraduate, he interned at an AI-focused company and created an optimized data pipeline for financial analytics for their law firm partner. At the same time, he operated as a lead on full stack efforts for the NYC Code and Coffee organization for their event management platform. 

Tyler grew up in Brooklyn, New York. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking,  listening to a variety of podcasts and think pieces, exploring interests in graphic design as well as language learning, and diving into various musical genres.

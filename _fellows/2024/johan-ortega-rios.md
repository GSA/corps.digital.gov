Johan graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. While at Illinois, Johan was a member of Wagglenet, a student-run research group with the goal of developing IOT solutions for beekeepers. Though he enjoys hardware, he found that the inherent malleability of software was better suited for his goals and projects. 

Outside of work, Johan plays the bass, works out, and occasionally posts on his phlog.

Josey received her B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with a focus in Biomechanics from Marquette University in 2019. After graduation, keen to explore the various facets of the healthcare industry, she initially worked as a medical patent engineer at an intellectual property firm and then as an on-site biomedical engineer for a pediatric hospital. These experiences opened her eyes to the fact that, while she loved working with technology, she wanted to further explore the relationship between end users and the products and services with which they interact.

In 2022, to pursue this newfound interest, she started a Master of Science program in Human-Computer Interaction at Georgia Tech. There, she discovered her passion for the intersection between Product Management and User Experiences, working on projects that engaged her in end-to-end product development and end user collaboration. Throughout her time at Georgia Tech, she also worked as a Graduate Research Assistant for the AI-CARING Institute under the auspices of the National Science Foundation. Her work, which she is planning to publish, leverages qualitative research methods to better understand the needs and experiences of people diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment and those coordinating their care.

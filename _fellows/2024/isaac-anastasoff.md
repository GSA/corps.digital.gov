Isaac graduated from the University of California, Riverside with a B.A. in Public Policy. While at UC Riverside, he spent a summer in Washington, D.C., working at the National Immigration Forum as a Strategic Partnerships Intern, where he developed recommendations for organization software. During college, Isaac frequently engaged with professors in his Public Policy classes, especially during the pandemic, to discuss the policy implications of the crisis. He also worked as a CaliforniansForAll Program Fellow at the City of Riverside, where he created and deployed an application mapping memorial trees for residents of Riverside.

Prior to college, Isaac grew up in the small town of Porterville in the Central Valley of California, known for its gateway into Sequoia National Forest.

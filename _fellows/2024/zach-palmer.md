bio_short: Data scientist interested in the ethical use of data and software to improve the equity of outcomes and prevent exploitation of vulnerable populations
why: I believe strongly in the contract between the American people and our government; that the federal government has a duty to provide adequate services, support, and aid to all, especially our most vulnerable. With these beliefs in mind, I felt that USDC was the perfect place for me to leverage my technical skills to help the federal government effectively serve its constituents, while also giving me the opportunity to mentor under incredibly talented and knowledgeable public servants. 
fun_fact: "Zach has hiked/scrambled in the Flatirons, hiked to the top of Crater Lake, and backpacked along the Tuolumne River in Yosemite."

Zach graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a B.S. in both Computer Science and Data Science, while also receiving a minor in Applied Statistics. During his senior year at Pitt, he collaborated with the University's men's soccer team to help develop a dynamic web application that analyzes positional data from past games to optimize player performance and recovery. He is interested in the ethical use of data and software to improve the equity of outcomes and prevent exploitation of vulnerable populations. 

Zach grew up in Buffalo, NY, where he pursued his passion for soccer from a young age, playing both for local clubs and his high school and has continued to play in local leagues as an adult. He is also an avid rock climber and boulderer who loves hiking and scrambling; with one of his lifetime goals, or hopes, being to visit all of the national parks.

When he isn't coding, working with data, or planning his next ascent, you can often find Zach reading fantasy or sci-fi with a cat in his lap.

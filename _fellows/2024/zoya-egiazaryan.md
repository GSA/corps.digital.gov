Zoya graduated from the Master of Human-Computer Interaction program at Carnegie Mellon University in 2023. She focused her efforts on developing products that are ethical, accessible, and human-centered. She emphasizes the importance of conducting thorough research in product management in order to better understand user pain points and make data-driven decisions. She previously received her B.A. in Psychology with a Specialization in Computing from UCLA in 2022. 

Zoya was also involved in nonprofit work as a Student Advisory Committee board member, where she oversaw a pilot project initiative that aimed to provide aid to youth involved with the Juvenile Justice System in the state of California. In doing so, she interviewed legislative offices and monitored political developments in regard to youth mental health policy. Outside of work, Zoya spends her time running on either roads or trails, or scrambling to find the words for her next poem.

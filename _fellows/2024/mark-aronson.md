hometown: Westborough, MA
university: Boston University
region: northeast
bio_short: Data scientist passionate about using math to understand biological and human health systems
why: After doing research in the basic sciences, I was looking for ways to apply the computational modeling skills I learned in graduate school to projects with more a direct application and in a way that serves the public interest. The opportunity with the Digital Corps met those criteria while also providing a vibrant community of other fellows to engage with and learn alongside. 
fun_fact: 'Mark loves hosting parties themed on obscure holidays. Past favorites include Area Code Day (November 10th) and Yell “Fudge” at the Cobras in North America Day (June 2nd).'

Mark graduated from the John Martinson Honors College and the College of Engineering at Purdue University with a B.S. in Biological Engineering and holds a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University. 

Since his first introduction to genetics and Punnett squares, Mark has been captivated with using math to understand biological and human health systems. This fascination led him to pursue research in synthetic biology, systems biology, and biophysics, where he studied the dynamical properties of intracellular signaling pathways using computational modeling and experimental methods. Throughout his scientific training, Mark has had the privilege to work with many talented undergraduate research assistants and serves as an alumni mentor for multiple mentoring programs through his alma mater. When not coding up a new model, Mark enjoys going for a run along the Potomac or trying out a new way to prepare tofu.

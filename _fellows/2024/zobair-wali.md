Zobair earned both his M.S. and B.S. in Cybersecurity from Old Dominion University. He was one of the first students to receive ODUâ€™s CyberCorps SFS scholarship, funded by the National Science Foundation, a program aimed at training the next generation of cybersecurity professionals and leaders to join the federal government.

Zobair is an emerging cybersecurity leader and has served as the President of the Coastal Virginia Cybersecurity Student Association (CVCSA) and later founded Virginia Cybersecurity Students (VCyS), funded by the Commonwealth Cyber Initiative. Both platforms have significantly benefited cybersecurity students by sharing resources and closing the technical gap needed in the field.

Growing up in the fragile democracy of Afghanistan and later moving to the United States, Zobair believes in protecting democratic freedoms and values, such as election security and critical infrastructure. He is passionate about AI and cybersecurity, proactive cyber defense, and cybersecurity leadership. 

Outside of work, Zobair loves traveling, swimming, and going on walks.

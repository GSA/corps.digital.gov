bio_short: Data scientist committed to ensuring that emerging technologies are implemented ethically and in a manner that benefits society as a whole
why: As my career transitions into data science and artificial intelligence, I am committed to ensuring that these emerging technologies are implemented ethically and in a manner that benefits society as a whole. I am particularly drawn to the USDC because of their dedication to developing innovative technological solutions that are equitable, trustworthy, and impactful for the American people. I cannot think of a more exciting program to learn from and contribute to.

Transitioning from a role in healthcare as a pharmacist, Kyle graduated from Johns Hopkins University with an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence. He strives to push the boundaries of innovation and application to solve the complex problems facing society. His work has included developing an audio classifier to monitor protected rainforests, deepfake classifiers to identify deepfake images and video, and a patient simulator application to train medical students. 

His biggest accomplishment to date lies in teaching his cats tricks like sit, shake, and twirl.

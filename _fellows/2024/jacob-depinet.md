Jacob is a recent graduate from Ohio State University with a B.S. in Data Analytics, a specialization in Social Science Analytics, and a minor in Womenâ€™s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. She came to this combination of statistics, computer science, analytical sociology, and gender studies to build a rich toolkit that could be used to understand and advocate for the lives of others. During her time in undergrad, Jacob was exposed to the public interest technology sphere through Coding it Forward's Civic Digital Fellowship where they served as a Data Analyst to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Outside of tech, Jacob enjoys trail running, reading nonfiction, and exploring new cafes and restaurants in Columbus!

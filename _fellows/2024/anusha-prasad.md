region: east
bio_short: Software engineer with a background in the private sector passionate about public policy and volunteering
why: Having worked in the private sector, I was not able to see the direct impact of my contributions. Thus, I began looking to transition into the public sector. I think the U.S. Digital Corps provides a great pathway into engaging with technology development more meaningfully. Getting to work with government agencies that are using advanced software for more effective policy/decision making is where I can make the most impact. 
fun_fact: 'Anusha collects magnets from countries and cities she/friends/family have traveled to. She currently has over 50 magnets and an overcrowded fridge.'

Anusha graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Computer Science and special concentrations in merging Artificial Intelligence and People. While in college, she was involved in multiple organizations that helped both the students in her school and the overall community. She built software applications for an organization to use when hosting hackathons and other STEM-related events. Having a passion for volunteering, she worked to organize efforts in the Atlanta area, including holiday toy drives and building blankets for dogs at the local animal shelter. Prior to the U.S. Digital Corps, Anusha worked as a software developer in the private sector. 

In her free time, Anusha enjoys playing a great game of tennis and exploring hiking trails. She also likes to travel and learn about different cultures while sampling their delicious foods. She has an interest in both tasting and cooking meals from other countries.

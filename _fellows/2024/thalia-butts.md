bio_short: Designer and writer passionate about humanizing user experiences with meaningful content design
why: My dear friend, Soror, and fellow Claflin University alumna, Kai Cobb, shared the program online during HBCU Week 2023. After reading more about the fellowship and talking to her about her experience, I felt confident that the USDC was the right next step for my career.
fun_fact: "Thalia's favorite social outing is a trivia night."

Thalia is a writer, content designer, and strategist who prioritizes human-centric, accessible, and solution-focused design approaches. She's contributed research-led content design to a variety of user experiences, from helping business owners schedule appointments to designing more private at-home STI testing.

She studied journalism at Claflin University and strategic communications at the University of South Carolina. Always eager to learn new skills, she has recently become an amateur triathlete and baker.

When Thalia isn't humanizing user experiences with meaningful content design, she's likely working on her blog, exploring local state parks, planning trips, connecting with her community, or enjoying a book from her beloved neighborhood library.

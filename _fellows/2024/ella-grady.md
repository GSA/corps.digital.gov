bio_short: Software engineer passionate about making technology accessible, especially for historically underserved communities
why: While getting my degree in computer science and political science, I often felt there were places the government could be taking greater efforts to implement modern technologies and increasing equitable access to public resources for stronger communities. I think USDC recruiting young tech professionals is a great step to do just this. I have always wanted to use my experience in technology to create solutions for the benefit of the public and saw USDC as a way to do so, resonating with the Digital Corp mission of helping new professionals understand the impact they can have on creating a more equitable and effective government. 
fun_fact: 'Ella grew up traveling and grew to love exploring the world even more while traveling during her year studying abroad in Scotland. Most recently she backpacked Southeast Asia with a friend after graduating college, a top experience of that trip being bathing with elephants rescued from inhumane conditions in Thailand.'

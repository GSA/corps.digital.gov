bio_short: Software engineer passionate about making technology accessible, especially for historically underserved communities
why: While getting my political science degree, I have often thought that there are places the government should be taking greater efforts to implement modern technologies. I think USDC recruiting young tech professionals is a great step to do just this. I have always wanted to use my experience in technology to create solutions for the benefit of the public and saw USDC as a way to do so.

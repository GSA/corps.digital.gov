Christina graduated from San José State University (SJSU) with a B.A. in Psychology and minors in Computer Science and Human Systems Integration. After spending time in education administration, she returned to SJSU to pursue a Master’s in Human Factors and Ergonomics with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction.

Christina was drawn to human factors and the civic tech field because of their potential to improve lives through human-centered design decisions. She previously served as a Civic Innovation Corps fellow for Coding it Forward and is excited to begin a new chapter as part of the United States Digital Corps (USDC).

Prior to the USDC, Christina worked at a user experience consultancy, where she helped tackle research and design challenges across a variety of domains including e-commerce, AR/VR, defense logistics, and medicine.

Christina lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her partner and in her spare time enjoys hiking, reading, and trying new foods.

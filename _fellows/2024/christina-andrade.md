Christina graduated from San José State University with a B.A. in Psychology and minors in Computer Science and Human Systems Integration. After spending some time in education administration, she returned to SJSU and also earned a Master’s in Human Factors and Ergonomics with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction. 

Christina was drawn to Human Factors because of the potential to improve lives through human-centered design decisions. This drive has influenced her life in many ways from informing her capstone project on protecting consumers from deceptive designs to the opportunities she’s pursued, including serving as a Civic Innovation Corps fellow and now her new chapter as a fellow for US Digital Corps (USDC). 

Prior to the USDC, Christina worked at a user experience consultancy, where she helped tackle research and design challenges across a variety of domains including e-commerce, AR/VR, defense logistics, and medicine. 

Christina lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her partner and in her spare time enjoys hiking, reading, and trying new foods.

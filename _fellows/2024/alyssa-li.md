Alyssa loves solving messy problems through human-centered design. She has a background in physical product design, and holds a Bachelor's degree from MIT and Master's degree from Stanford in mechanical engineering.

In order to directly serve marginalized communities, Alyssa has since dedicated her career to designing better public services. As a Coding it Forward Fellow, Alyssa led a user research project to modernize internal communication systems at Philadelphia Parks and Recreation. Prior to that, she partnered with Bay Area nonprofits to increase food access in affordable housing communities and to develop a digital check-in system for supportive interim housing facilities. Ultimately, Alyssa aims to design effective, equitable systems that enable members of vulnerable communities to pursue secure and meaningful lives. 

In her free time, Alyssa enjoys dancing, reading, knitting sweaters, and baking birthday cakes for her friends and family.

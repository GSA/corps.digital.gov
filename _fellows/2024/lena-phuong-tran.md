bio_short: Designer passionate about tackling complex social issues through an equity-centered lens
why: Coming from a community that doesn't always fit the normative defaults for a user, I've witnessed the ways that technology and design can serve some users while neglecting others. These experiences, coupled with my past work with government partners at both the city and state levels, motivated me to join USDC. I see the fellowship as an opportunity to work on improving government services in meaningful ways and ultimately ensuring they meet the needs of all individuals, regardless of their backgrounds or identities. 
fun_fact: 'Lena-Phuong grew up in what was once rumored to be one of the most diverse zip codes in the country (98118).'

Ellis graduated from the Georgetown McCourt School with a Master's in Data Science for Public Policy. At Georgetown, he was a scholar at the Massive Data Institute, leveraging big data to address critical climate and environmental issues. Since graduating, Ellis has continued in this field, focusing on technology and sustainability with The Green Grid.

Ellis has always been passionate about the intersection of statistical analysis and social issues. Before graduate school, he worked as a data analyst in the catastrophe modeling industry, quantifying financial and societal risks from natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, and wildfires. Ellis double majored in Economics and African American Studies at Bates College.

When heâ€™s not wrestling with Python or R, Ellis spends as much time as he can outdoors. He loves hiking, skiing, disc golf, and distance running. Look for him on the trails of the C&O canal or Rock Creek Park on weekends.

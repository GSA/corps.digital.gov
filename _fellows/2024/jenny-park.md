bio_short: Data scientist passionate about using technical skills to support broader social change and public good
why: With my first computer science course I took in college, I knew that I wanted to use my skills to support broader social change and public good. Since then, I have been cultivating both my knowledge in peace studies and conflict transformation alongside my technical skills in data science. USDC was the perfect opportunity to merge these interests into a career with a clear forward trajectory, an opportunity unlike any other options I had considered prior to learning about the program.

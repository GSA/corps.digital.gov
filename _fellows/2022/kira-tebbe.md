Kira graduated cum laude from Yale University with degrees in Sociology and Applied Mathematics, which she sees as two different ways of seeing the big picture. After working as a data scientist, she attended the The University of Chicago Booth School of Business to learn how to run effective, data-driven, and socially impactful programs that are effective, efficient, and financially sustainable. While at Booth, Kira interned with the City Colleges of Chicago, analyzing enrollment data to identify strategies to increase the attendance of GED and ESL students. She also worked with one of the largest childcare providers in Chicago, and the YWCA. Outside of her professional life, she enjoys playing games of all types, rollerblading, volunteering in girls' education, and talking with strangers.

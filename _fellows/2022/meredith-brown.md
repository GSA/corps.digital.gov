Meredith is committed to leveraging data to improve the lives of all citizens. She attended Duke University, where she studied Computer Science and Statistics. At Duke, she was a SPIRE Fellow, head Teaching Assistant for the Statistics Department, captain of the Womenâ€™s Club Soccer team, and Vice President of Gameday Operations for the Cameron Crazies. 

Her interests lie at the intersection of public policy and data science, working on projects such as how social determinants of health can aid in predicting hospital admissions or examining patterns in public and private funding to oncology centers. In her free time, you can find her playing soccer, doing a crossword, or cheering for Duke basketball.

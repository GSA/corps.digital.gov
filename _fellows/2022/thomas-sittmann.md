I was very fortunate that I was able to complete a Pathway's internship with CISA.Having worked in the technology sector and also being in the military, I could see the critical need for technology specialists.  I also wanted work as a civil servant again and USDC helped fill that desire while providing a great opportunity.  It paired my passion to continue serving with helping filling that technology gap we have in the United States.

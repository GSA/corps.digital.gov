As an immigrant and a veteran, I experienced the government services first hand. I understand how difficult it is to navigate and use government services, and I want to use my skills and experiences to make them more accessible and equitable for the American people. USDC is a perfect pathway for a new civic technologist like me to gain experience in civic technology field and explore different agencies' projects.

I cherish the country that allowed my family to start anew on free shores, and I was inspired to join by the need to improve our nation's cybersecurity. America and Americans are more dependent on technology than ever, but there's a gap between where we are in our defensive posture and where we need to be. It is an honor to help solve some of these technological challenges and make our nation a little bit better, and a little bit more secure, for everyone.

I chose to join the U.S. Digital Corps for a few key reasons. First, the program addresses critical needs in the federal IT workforce. Second, the program brings together a cohort of people who are passionate about civic tech. Third, the program intentionally invests in the professional development and and growth of its fellows. Fourth, the program offers a position to apply my skills and experiences and develop new competencies. Finally, the program provides an opportunity to serve the U.S. Government and the American people.

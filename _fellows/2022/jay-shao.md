why: "I chose to join the U.S. Digital Corps becuase it addresses critical needs in the federal IT workforce and brings together a cohort of people who are passionate about civic tech. I am excited because the program also intentionally invests in the professional development and growth of its fellows and offers me a position to apply my skills and experiences and develop new competencies."

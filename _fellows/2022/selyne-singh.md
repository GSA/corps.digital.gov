Currently, I am a Management & Program Analyst for Commander, Navy Region Southeast, where I provide program analytic solutions. I was inspired to become a Digital Corps Fellow because I had the opportunity to perform a one month developmental assignment with the Navyâ€™s Chief Data Officer through the New Leader Program. That experience allowed me to see the benefits of using data for decision making, the value of data sharing, and how both of those are extremely underutilized. Being a part of the digital corps will enable me to be a part of the future workforce that changes the way we currently do work in the federal government. I'm excited to be  part of a cohort that will improve federal systems and technology.

While studying tech policy and learning from experts in cybersecurity, crisis informatics, and while interning at a large nonprofit, I realized how important it was to have more hands on experience with the development process. I was so excited when the USDC posting came up-- it is a wonderful opportunity to strengthen what I had learned while remaining in the public sector and working towards goals I am passionate about.

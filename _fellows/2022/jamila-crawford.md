I was inspired to join USDC because of its mission to provide opportunities within the federal government that fosters professional development for early-career technologists. In my efforts to transition from law enforcement to information technology, I was searching for an opportunity that would allow me to take the skills and knowledge I acquired in my graduate studies and professional experiences and use them in a role that will be committed to my professional growth and knowledge as an early-career technologist. My experience in applying for roles in the federal government have shown how challenging it is to get an opportunity without having extensive years of experience. The USDC is giving me and so many others a chance to use our education and technical and soft skills in a position that will make an impact in federal government technology at early stages of our career.

As a software product manager, I am motivated by solving meaningful problems for many people. In the private sector, my time might be occupied marginally increasing shopping cart sizes or making ads a little more “clickable”. In the public sector I can spend that same time streamlining access to vital services for millions. I find the latter much more inspiring, and the USDC helped me make that transition.

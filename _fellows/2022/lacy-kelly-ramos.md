bio_short: Designer ready to enhance resources for citizens across the country. 
why: "As a designer and technologist working with digital products, I’ve often felt a step (or two) removed from the impact of my work. After spending time in various roles for nonprofits and state agencies, I became more inspired by what my skill set can offer to public needs and the outcome of those efforts. It was exciting to learn about the Digital Corps and the exceptional work that many federal agencies are undertaking to enhance resources for citizens across the country and I'm excited to get started."
fun_fact: If there is a show about travel, Lacy has probably seen it. Learning about, exploring, and photographing new places is her favorite pastime.

Lacy is a first-generation college graduate with a B.F.A. in Graphic Design from Indiana University and a certificate in User Experience (UX) Design from the University of California, Berkeley. Lacy’s drive and commitment to make things better stem from her low-income childhood. This experience inspired her creativity, resourcefulness, and work ethic, and these characteristics guided her work in improving products and services in various sectors, including medicine, startups, non-profit, policy, and education. As a designer and life-long learner, she enjoys researching, testing, and designing digital products to best meet the needs of the end user. 

Lacy lives in Maryland with her husband Francisco and their dog Coltrane. She enjoys exploring new places, frequenting the many nearby museums, and reading non-fiction.

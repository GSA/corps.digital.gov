As a designer and technologist working with digital products, I’ve often felt a step (or two) removed from the impact of my work. After spending time in various roles for nonprofits and state agencies, I became more inspired by what my skill-set can offer to public needs and the outcome of those efforts. A recent move to the D.C. area helped me narrow my search for this type of service. It was exciting to learn about the USDC program and the exceptional work that many federal agencies are undertaking to enhance resources for citizens across the country. I’m very excited to be part of the inaugural cohort and look forward to the work!

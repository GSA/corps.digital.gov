I joined USDC because I believe in a model of government service delivery that requires listening to the needs and challenges of those we serve and making sure our offerings meet them where they are. I wanted to join this community of people who are working to make government services easier to access and apply to. To increase people's ability to learn about and access government services and feel confident that they will be supported and guided the whole way. Whether this means ensuring information is presented clearly or in a language they understand, making sure the phone line doesn't get dropped as they jump across different agencies, or acknowledging the high emotional states that some are in when they have to come to the government for help and ensuring they feel respected.

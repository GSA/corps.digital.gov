During the first few months of 2020, my research institute was closed, and I volunteered to do COVID-19 research in a laboratory. I felt like we were tackling big problems to benefit society. When the time came to look for a new position, I came across the U.S. Digital Corps. It was outside of my field, but I have experience in data science. The USDC is open to those who have taken a nontraditional path, and I can see how the projects will impact society.

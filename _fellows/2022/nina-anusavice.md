Being a UX designer for the VA has been my dream job since 2018, after attending the UXPA Boston Career Fair. Mary Ann Brody, a former U.S. Digital Service team member, was the keynote speaker where she presented a 2016 usability test of a veteran struggling to navigate and apply for health benefits on the veterans’ website.  Not only was he intermittently homeless and had not seen a doctor in more than eight years, but also he had a young daughter in his custody. However, after Ms. Brody’s team redesigned the site, the same veteran found the website easy to use, and he was able to apply for health benefits successfully. 

Ms. Brody's presentation was so emotionally moving that I had an epiphany and realized that was the type of UX work I wanted to do; however, at the same time, I knew getting to do that type of meaningful work was rare, and it would be a long shot for me to get a job at the VA.

I always wanted any work I do to be about creating really impact for real people. My experience as  a Coding it Forward fellow really cemented my interest in doing more work to improve government service delivery and processes. I saw the USDC as an opportunity to contribute to those efforts directly. I also saw the opportunity for mentorship and connection with other early-career folks for two years as extremely valuable to my own personal and professional growth. I'm so excited to just soak up this experience and learn a ton!

bio_short: Product manager passionate about people-centered policy. 
why: I have always wanted any work I do to be about creating really impact for real people. My experience as a Coding it Forward fellow really cemented my interest in doing more to improve government service delivery and processes, and I saw USDC as an opportunity to contribute to those efforts directly. The opportunity for mentorship and connection with other early-career folks for two years will be extremely valuable for my own personal and professional growth. I'm so excited to soak up this experience and learn a ton!

fun_fact: Julie is a huge film and television fan! For several years she hosted a Rob Reiner Film Festival for friends and fans, complete with screenings of the entire Rob Reiner directorial oeuvre, movie-related meals and snacks, and an Oscars-like “Meathead Awards” ceremony at the end. Rob Reiner was invited, and while he didn’t attend, he graciously sent a personal note expressing his surprise and delight to be honored in this way (and that he thought they were all a little nuts to be doing this.)

Julie holds a BA in Liberal Arts from George Washington University, and a MS in Information Security and Privacy from the University of Texas at Austin. As a long-time public servant, Julie is looking forward to working at the federal level through the U.S. Digital Corps, putting her expertise in data privacy, information security, and communications to work to make government more equitable and accessible to people seeking information and services. She is excited to return to her former home of Washington, D.C. and to rediscover the many delights of the city!

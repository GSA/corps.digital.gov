I've spent my formative career development years in such a juxtaposing era of technological innovation and worldwide chaos that, when I really came to ask myself the standard questions of: ""what kind of impact do you want to leave on this world"" and ""how can I contribute based on my skillset,"" USDC checked the boxes of: optimistic high-impact and you want (and, therefore recognize the need for) designers like me :)  

Slightly more nuanced: lifelong interdisciplinary interest in government, politics, and social welfare despite the standard STEM background; program's structure/team/potential feels promising and reassuring towards this sort of life direction

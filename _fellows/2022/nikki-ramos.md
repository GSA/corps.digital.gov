bio_short: Designer ready to build intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable products with impact. 
why: "I've spent my formative career development years in such a juxtaposing era of technological innovation and worldwide chaos. When I really came to ask myself the standard questions of 'what kind of impact do you want to leave on this world' and 'how can I contribute with my skillset,' the Digital Corps checked all the boxes by providing optimistic, high-impact work and recognizing the need for designers like me."

Nikki integrates her interests in human thinking and social good to build intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable products with impact. Prior to the U.S. Digital Corps, she has channeled this UX/UI, web design, and branding in various non-profit and startup spaces, from public health, higher-ed, and business development to arts, media, and entertainment. From her background (and in response to ongoing events), she approaches the design process with a lens of information processing and accessibility. 

Born in the Philippines and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Nikki's upbringing was shaped by vibrant diversity and cultural connection. She graduated from University of California, Los Angeles where she studied Cognitive Science and Digital Humanities in between advocating for first-year and first-gen student or tinkering with other Philipinos in Engineering and Sciences. 

When she's not staring at screens, Nikki can be found crafting, petting a cat, or running... late to yoga.

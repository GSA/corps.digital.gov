A throughline in my career has been working in organizations that are mission-oriented. While in graduate school, I learned more about careers within the federal government. I became excited about the prospect of modernizing products and services that serve the American public. Finally, I value intentionality and community; the cohort fellow model was carefully designed to connect diverse individuals united by a common purpose.

Nolan is a recent graduate of Cornell University, where he completed his Master's in Information Science with a focus in user experience (UX) design and interactive technologies. He enjoys working with emerging research and design methods that facilitate more enjoyable interactions with complex systems. 

As a Virginia local, Nolan grew up witnessing the impact of government service on the communities around him. This drive to help his fellow Americans led him to an interest in civic tech spaces. 

When not learning and practicing design, Nolan enjoys reading, art, music, and taking care of his plants.

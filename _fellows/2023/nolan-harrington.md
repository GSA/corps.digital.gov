Nolan is a recent graduate from Cornell University, where he completed his masters in Information Science with a focus in user experience (UX) design and interactive technologies. He enjoys working with emerging research & design methods that facilitate more enjoyable interactions with complex systems. 

As a Virginia local, he grew up witnessing the impact of government service on the communities around him. This drive to help fellow Americans led him to an interest in civic tech spaces. 

When not learning and practicing design, he enjoys reading, art, music, and taking care of his plants.

why: "From a young age, my parents instilled in me an appreciation for America's innovative spirit and a desire to make this country a more comfortable and equitable place for all Americans to enjoy. Having the opportunity to participate in this mission, specifically contributing to making the federal government's technological processes more agile and its services more accessible, is truly a dream come true. I am grateful for the chance to gain insights from a cohort of individuals who share the same aspiration of utilizing technology to foster positive change."

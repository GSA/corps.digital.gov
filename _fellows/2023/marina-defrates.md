bio_short: Designer passionate about leveraging the power of design for social impact
why: "I grew up wanting to be a doctor so I could help my mom, who suffered from a severe chronic illness during my childhood. While I eventually decided that my skills and interests were more suited to the world of design, the desire to be of service and do what I can to make a positive impact has been a constant throughout my life. I am so grateful that the U.S. Digital Corps has given me the opportunity to combine both!"
fun_fact: 'In an alternate reality, Marina would be either an acrobat or a nature photographer. She is currently learning how to do handstands and hopes to visit every major desert in the world.'

Marina is passionate about leveraging the power of design for social impact. Trained as an architect, she became increasingly interested in the design of digital spaces when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. She has gained civic tech experience through a variety of projects, from working with the Stanford Legal Design Lab to create a more user-friendly and accessible legal system, to increasing civic participation in government by redesigning a website and application process for the state of Utah as a Civic Innovation Corps Fellow.

Before receiving a Master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Marina was on a pre-med track studying biology and psychology. She finds the human body and mind fascinating and eagerly incorporates her knowledge into her design process. 

Marina was born and raised in Spokane, WA, and while she has spent most of her adult life in the Boston area, her heart belongs to the Pacific Northwest, where her favorite activity is quietly exploring its infinitely varied landscapes.

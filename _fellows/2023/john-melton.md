John earned his B.S. in Psychology with a minor in Neuroscience from Hope College in 2016, where he focused on neuroscience research with anxiety. While at Hope College, John also took courses in computer science as well as a combined course in mathematical biology, where he worked on software projects that predicted population growth for both animals and bacterial diseases. 

In 2021, John completed the Software Engineering Bootcamp from Springboard, where he developed the majority of his full-stack software engineering skills. He used that knowledge to apply for and receive the CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service at Davenport University that same year. Two years later, in 2023, John earned his Master's of Science in Computer Science from Davenport University, where he took courses in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data structures and algorithm design, and software security. 

John is a firm believer in continuous learning and working to become better everyday. Outside of school, work, or independent learning, he enjoys sports, exercising, outdoor activities, and playing computer games and board games.

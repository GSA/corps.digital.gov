Jina is a mission-driven designer with roots in healthcare and academic public health research. She graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.A. in Public Health Studies. 

Jina discovered her passion for civic design during her time as a patient advocate at a community health clinic where she helped patients apply for public benefits. Seeing firsthand their frustrations while navigating these online applications, and also how much of a positive impact these public benefits had on their lives, caused her to pivot from pursuing a career in medicine to civic design. In her free time, Jina enjoys going to the beach and checking out new restaurants with her friends.

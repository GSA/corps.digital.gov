Jess earned a master’s degree in Data Analytics and Policy at Johns Hopkins University. For her capstone, she studied factors that impact access to mental health treatment. As a graduate student, Jess interned at a national laboratory and gained data science experience working for a civic organization and a campaign.

She is a career changer, formerly a counselor and educator with more than a decade of experience in childcare, K-12, higher education, and healthcare settings. Jess has a master’s degree in Counseling and bachelor’s degree in Psychology from The College of New Jersey. Her passion for social justice drew her to public policy, and in 2020 she decided to elevate her love for data and spreadsheets by learning to code.

Jess loves plants, music, and animals, especially her cat, and she spends as much time as possible in the sunshine.

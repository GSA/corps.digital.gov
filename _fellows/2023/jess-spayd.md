bio_short: Data scientist and career changer with experience in childcare, education, and healthcare
why: "I made the transition into technology because I wanted my work to have an impact on public policy. When I learned about USDC during the recruitment of the first cohort, it immediately became my goal to join the following year. USDC is a perfect fit for my newly acquired skills and my passion for public service."
fun_fact: 'Jess is a published lyricist and was the lead singer of a few bands in her twenties. She still frequents karaoke nights.'

Jess earned a Master’s degree in Data Analytics and Policy from Johns Hopkins University. For her capstone, she studied factors that impact access to mental health treatment. As a graduate student, Jess interned at a national laboratory and gained data science experience working for a civic organization and a campaign.

Jess is a career changer—she was previously a counselor and educator and has more than a decade of experience in childcare, K-12, higher education, and healthcare settings. She has a master’s degree in Counseling and a bachelor’s degree in Psychology from The College of New Jersey. Her passion for social justice drew her to public policy, and in 2020 she decided to elevate her love for data and spreadsheets by learning to code.

Jess loves plants, music, and animals, especially her cat, and she spends as much time as possible in the sunshine.

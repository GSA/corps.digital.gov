Erin graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in Computer Science and minors in Data Science and Human Rights History. As a student, she spent most of her time developing software projects for nonprofits and teaching in K-12 STEM programs. Prior to the U.S. Digital Corps, Erin worked as a software engineer in the private sector.

In her free time, Erin enjoys exploring cities through their public spaces, storytelling through different creative mediums, and sharing home-cooked meals with friends. She can often be found eating tangerines or aggravating her cat Stitches.

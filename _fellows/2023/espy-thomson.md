bio_short: Designer passionate about helping elevate unheard voices through her skills redesigning systems, services, and products
why: "After working with local residents to help a city government hear and understand their housing needs, I became interested in civic tech. I was excited to discover the U.S. Digital Corps because it provides a gateway to do the work I want to do with the potential for large-scale impact. There is also an amazing community of designers, with support for early-career professionals."
fun_fact: 'Espy crewed on a marine science and education tall ship that sailed from San Diego to Tahiti.'

Espy is a creative problem solver who has strode with purpose down her non-linear path. She is passionate about helping elevate unheard voices through her skills redesigning systems, services, and products. Espy previously worked as Dartmouth College’s Human-Centered Design Fellow, where she supported human-centered design classes and co-developed and managed the college’s first service design program.

Her approach to design and research has been informed by her civic work on the built environment, sociological research jobs, and digital community activism work. It has also been informed by her personal upbringing in a queer, cross-cultural family and in rural and small town communities with no digital access. She holds a B.A. in Environmental Science and Policy with a focus on Urban Design from Smith College.

Alongside her work, Espy can be found writing, learning how to sail, and playing ultimate.

hometown:  Ventura, CA
university: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
region: west
bio_short: Designer ready to work in the service of helping people.
why: "I've always been extremely passionate about making sure that whatever I was doing, it was in the service of helping people and trying to make the world a better place. After a prior fellowship with Coding It Forward, I realized that federal service represented a quite excellent opportunity to achieve that outcome of helping others. From there, the US Digital Corps seemed to me to be an absolutely great entry-level pathway to do the work of helping others while developing into a professional designer at the same time."
fun_fact: 'Jaxon was a radio DJ during college, and will go on for hours about indie music if you let him. He currently keeps that fire alive by trying to learn the live mixing board as one of his fun side projects.'

Jaxon is keen on utilizing design to affirm the lived experiences of others and give them the tools to live more empowered and meaningful lives. It is that passion that led to him graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a B.S. in Liberal Arts and Engineering Studies and a minor in Gender, Race, Culture, Science and Technology. He strives to understand the gestalt of all people he meets and be a good friend to all.

In his free time, Jaxon loves to hike, snowboard, dabble in photography, and dive deep into whatever given topic has piqued his interest for the month.

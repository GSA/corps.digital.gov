Kennedy graduated with a B.S. in Philosophy from Brooklyn College- CUNY and received a Master’s in Urban Planning from the University at Buffalo- SUNY. Prior to joining the U.S. Digital Corps, Kennedy worked in a variety of different sectors, including corporate banking, technology, and government. In each role, Kennedy’s commitment to promoting the social, human, and economic development of low-income communities, nationally and internationally, remained. 

Kennedy’s pivot from urban planner to product manager began during her last semester of graduate school when she competed in a fintech design challenge where her team placed second. They developed MyFortune, an app that taught first-time earners financial education based on their money personality type. Kennedy saw the speed and impact that technology could have at delivering services to users and knew this was the space she wanted to have a career in.

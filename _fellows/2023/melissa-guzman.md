Melissa earned a B.A. in Computer Science at Wellesley College, where she researched smart computing technology and developed an interest in the social impacts of software technology. She is passionate about learning how to ethically design technologies like AI and create policies to manage their development.

Melissa started her software development career at an entertainment company, where she learned how financial technology is used in the entertainment industry and developed back-end engineering skills through various feature development work. She has also participated in outreach engagement through events like the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.

Outside of her professional life, Melissa is firmly rooted in her community and is passionate about giving back. In 2022, she was a fellow in the ING Fellowship, in which she collaborated with her peers on a summer initiative to organize a resource fair to inform community members of their tenant rights. Currently, she is a member of the marketing and fundraising committee, where she has organized a scholarship fundraiser for students in her community.

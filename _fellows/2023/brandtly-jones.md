Brandtly is curious about everything from the very old to the very new. He pursued his passion for Latin and Ancient Greek all the way through a PhD at Cornell University, after which he taught classics for over 15 years. More recently, he was inspired to tackle new challenges. Intrigued by advances in machine learning and AI, he began to nourish a dormant love of mathematics and to learn to use code to solve real-world problems. In 2022, Brandtly made the leap to pursue data science as a new career, and in 2023 he completed a Masters of Data Science from the University of Virginia. He is passionate about the ethical use of data to tackle global challenges.

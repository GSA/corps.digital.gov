Alyssa graduated from Thomas Jefferson University with an M.B.A. in Healthcare Analytics. In addition, for the past five years she has worked as a product manager at a large public health organization, where she was responsible for a portfolio of evidence-based software tools. In that role, she handled everything from technical support to designing and testing software updates in order to advance products that translate research into action in the field. She previously received her B.A. in Biology from Vassar College.

Outside of work, Alyssa jokes that her number one hobby is collecting new hobbies. She can usually be found doing crossword puzzles, gardening with her wife, refinishing furniture, or playing endless games of fetch with her dog Kipling.

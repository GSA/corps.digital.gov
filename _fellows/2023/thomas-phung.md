Fast forward to the present, U.S. Digital Corps offers a unique opportunity to grow professionally and personally in this positive environment to foster future leaders that will serve the public and empower them through technology. I am ecstatic to see where this journey takes me and like-minded USDC Fellows! Let’s build an equitable future together!"

Thomas is a proud second-generation Asian American born and raised in Washington state where he earned his Bachelor’s in Software Development at Lake Washington Institute of Technology.

To Thomas, it's a duty—not a privilege—to serve the American people as a way to give back to our communities.

Despite being an early-career technologist, he is heavily involved in open-source wiki projects as a volunteer administrator, moderator, developer, researcher, and editor for over 5 years. What started as a hobby of fixing typos blossomed into a passion for developing solutions that deliver accurate, relevant, and timely information to educate the public. Thomas strongly believes that online spaces (and by extension, society at large) deserve accountability, participation, transparency, and inclusivity through information equity.

Outside of software development, Thomas is a curious individual who is passionate about topics such as Internet culture, video game & anime industries, wikis, open data, video game photography, digital archiving, and politics.

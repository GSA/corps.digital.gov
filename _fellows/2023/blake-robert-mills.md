Blake graduated from Columbia University with a B.A. in Political Science and Statistics, focusing his studies on public health, sustainable development, and public interest technology. Blake began as a self-taught coder in R and data visualization and continued developing these skills in the classroom and through self-developed projects. 

Blake now uses everything he's learned to work on projects involving the intersections of data, tech, cities, public service, and the arts. Blake is particularly passionate about taking complex data and coming up with innovative and creative ways to express it in hopes of inspiring a deeper understanding of the world we live in, meaningful solutions to problems, and identifying new potential projects. 

Outside of work, Blake enjoys all things art—paintings, design, fashion, art history, and New York’s many museums.

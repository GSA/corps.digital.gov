Alex graduated from Georgetown University with a Master's Degree in Data Science for Public Policy. While at Georgetown, he worked as a research assistant at the Massive Data Institute, focusing on political partisanship among members of Congress, and the Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation, researching relationships between public protests and property values. After graduation, he spent a year working as a data analyst at a non-profit which provides broadband access to the public.

Alex grew up in Melbourne, Florida, close enough to Cape Canaveral to see rocket launches from his backyard. He received a B.S. in Political Science and a B.A. in Spanish from Florida State University, where he completed an undergraduate thesis on public opinion and the American dream. As an undergraduate, he interned with the Florida legislature and the Michigan Department of State. In his spare time, he likes playing board games, tabletop role-playing games, and video games, listening to podcasts, baking, and solving crossword puzzles and other word games.

bio_short: Product manager excited about driving impact in the federal government
why: "I wanted the opportunity to accomplish fulfilling work with passionate people. To me, fulfilling work is that which challenges me to make the most of my strengths and encourages me to ask uncomfortable, bigger-picture questions. To me, passionate people are those who can articulate how their values drive their personal and professional goals and decision-making, and who inspire me to do the same. I am deeply excited to engage with the U.S. Digital Corps community as we grow and learn together."
fun_fact: During his first year of high school, Tom Holland went undercover pretending to be a student at Alex's school.

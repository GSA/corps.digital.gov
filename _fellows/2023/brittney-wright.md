Brittney is a U.S Air Force Veteran with a strong dedication to public service. While serving active duty in the military as an emergency medical technician (EMT), she attained her Masters of Business Administration and received the John L. Levitow Award as the top-ranked student who demonstrated outstanding leadership and scholastic qualities in Airman Leadership School. She was also hand-selected to work as an EMT at the White House during the Covid-19 global pandemic and received a Humanitarian Service Medal.  

Her passion for cybersecurity grew after completing a three-month cybersecurity bootcamp, where she was able to learn many cybersecurity tools, techniques, and procedures such as Kali Linux, Command Line, Python, Wireshark, Nmap, and Metasploit.  

Brittney was a captain on the University of North Florida Women's Basketball team throughout undergrad, where she received a B.S. in Communication (Mass Media), and she has also competed for a gold medal while playing for the All-Armed Forces Air Force Women's Basketball team. In her off time, she enjoys spending quality time with her wife and dog, traveling, gardening, and exercising.

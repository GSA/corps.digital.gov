            The Digital Corps is an early-career technology opportunity for those from undergraduate degree programs,
            apprenticeships, bootcamps, reskilling, and other training programs. No work experience is required, though
            we expect candidates to have the requisite technical skills and training.

            While we build a big tent around what it means to be a technologist—including software engineering, product
            management, design, data science and analysis, and cybersecurity—we recognize that technology is a means,
            not an end. As such, we’re looking for candidates who aren’t afraid to roll up their sleeves and contribute
            in any way, technical or otherwise, to create a government that better serves all Americans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Government technology and civic tech is a team sport, and we expect Digital Corps fellows to be empathetic,
            collaborative, and mission-oriented.

          The U.S. Digital Corps is an early&#8209;career technology opportunity for those graduating from
          undergraduate and graduate degree programs, apprenticeships, bootcamps, reskilling, and other
          training programs. Because we are seeking technologists that have recently completed their programs,
          no prior full-time work experience is required, though we expect candidates to have the requisite
          technical skills and training.

          While we build a big tent around what it means to be a technologist—including software engineering, product
          management, design, data science and analysis, and cybersecurity—we recognize that technology is a means,
          not an end. As such, we’re looking for candidates who aren’t afraid to roll up their sleeves and contribute
          in any way, technical or otherwise, to create a government that better serves all Americans.
        </p>
        <p class="lg text-left">
          Government technology and civic tech is a team sport, and we expect Digital Corps fellows to be empathetic,
          collaborative, and mission-oriented.

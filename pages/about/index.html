        U.S. Digital Corps History
      </h1>
      <p class="lg text-left">
        The U.S. Digital Corps was launched by <span class="tbd">(OFFICE) in (MONTH)</span> 2021.
        It is a cross&#8209;government fellowship opportunity operated by the General Service Administration’s
        <a class="usa-link"
          href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services">
          Technology Transformation Services</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="lg text-left margin-bottom-0 padding-bottom-2">
        The idea for a Digital Corps was sparked by technologists across government who saw a gap in the
        federal government’s journey towards digital success - a lack of early&#8209;career technology talent.
        Technology Transformation Services (TTS) saw the need for entry-level technologists to not only bring
        immediate innovation but also to serve as a continuing resource for government digital transformation.
        These technologists would help complement the civic technology efforts already underway by organizations
        like TTS while bringing in fresh perspectives. What started as an idea and grassroots effort evolved
        into the U.S. Digital Corps.

      momentum and was inspired by American symbols including service members’ uniforms and the Space Shuttle.

      The toggle logo design evokes the Digital Corps' focus on technology and is set in the ”on” position to form a
      shooting star symbolizing inspiration and progress. The reversed flag orientation indicates unstoppable forward
      momentum and was inspired by American symbols including servicemember uniforms and the Space Shuttle.

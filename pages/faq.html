                <p>We recommend that you apply to the track that most closely matches your skill set and prior experience.

                <p>Our team works thoughtfully to match Fellows with agencies where they can make the greatest impact, taking into account both the needs of the agency and the strengths of each candidate. During the <a class="usa-link" href="{{site.baseurl}}/process/#timeline">selection process</a>, candidates will have the opportunity to indicate their interests and preferences. However, Fellows’ final placement will be based on mutual interest between candidates and agencies as well as the alignment of skill sets. This ensures a placement that is beneficial for both the Fellow and the agency.</p>

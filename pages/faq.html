                <button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="application-limit">
                    Why is there a limit to the number of applications in each track?
                </button>
            </h2>
            <div id="application-limit" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
                <p>Each year we aim to hire a set number of Fellows across the five tracks, and an application limit ensures that we are able to thoughtfully and equitably review each application that we receive. The federal hiring process is time-intensive and intentional; every application is reviewed in detail by at least two subject matter experts—we do not use any automated screening methods or filter applicants by school, previous work experience, or any other characteristic.</p>

                    Is the program remote? Will I have to move to Washington, D.C.?

            </h2>
            <div id="is-remote" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
                <p>Digital Corps Fellows will be able to work remotely, in-person, or in a hybrid model subject to the needs of their placement agency. Fellows will have the option of working from Washington D.C. where many agencies are headquartered. Your location will be negotiated and determined during the selection process.</p>
                <p>Fellows who are not located in Washington, D.C. should expect to travel occasionally for agency work and/or program events. All official travel costs will be covered by the program.</p>

                <button class="usa-accordion__button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="locality-pay">
                    Will my salary change depending on my work location?

            </h2>
            <div id="locality-pay" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
                <p>Yes, Fellows’ salary will vary depending on work location (including telework) according to the Office of Personnel Management’s <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2021/general-schedule/">locality pay tables</a>. All Digital Corps Fellows will begin the two-year program at the GS&#8209;9 pay level and receive a recruitment incentive.</p>
                <p>Fellows will receive a total recruitment incentive equivalent to 50% of the GS-9 starting salary, with the payout weighted toward the first year. As an example, in 2022 with the recruitment incentive, Washington, D.C.-based Fellows will have a starting total salary just above $80,000.</p>

The U.S. Digital Corps is a paid, full-time opportunity for two years with a path to a career position in the federal government. Fellows will benefit from a dedicated learning and development curriculum, mentorship, and other support structures to grow both personally and professionally during the fellowship.</p>

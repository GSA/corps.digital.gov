                        <p>Prior to submitting an application for the U.S. Digital Corps, you should:</p>
                        <ul class="usa-list">
                            <li>Review details about the program opportunity, including location and fellowship experience. <span class="tbd">[Link to The Opportunity page]</span></li>
                            <li>Review our <a href="#eligibility">eligibility criteria</a>.</li>
                            <li>Review the job announcement. <span class="tbd">[Link to “Job announcement” on Apply page]</span></li>
                            <li>Select your track.
                                <p>We are recruiting Digital Corps Fellows in five skill tracks: software engineering, data science, product management, design, and cybersecurity.  <span class="tbd">[Link to The Opportunity page; section on tracks]</span></p>
                                <p>Apply for the track in which you have the most experience. It’s okay if you have experience or interest in more than one area, but we ask that you select the track that most closely matches your skill set. Doing so will help our team thoughtfully pair candidates with agencies and projects. Your track selection will not limit the projects you are considered for and Digital Corps Fellows will have ample opportunity to learn and grow in areas beyond their selected track.</p>
                                <p>You may apply for up to two specialty tracks. Candidates who apply to more than two tracks will only be considered in two tracks.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Review the minimum qualifications/required competencies/specialized experience in your track of choice. <span class="tbd">[Link to Apply page, tracks section]</span>
                                <p>Your resume must reflect either an advanced degree in a technology field or one cumulative year of experience in the minimum qualifications/required competencies/specialized experience specific to your track to be considered. This can include paid or unpaid volunteer experiences, internships, student organizations, and jobs.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Prepare your resume and transcript</li>
                            <ul class="usa-list">
                            <li>Resume (PDF format required). Subject matter experts will review the first three pages of your resume for the minimum qualifications/required competencies/specialized experience described above. We recommend using one page to detail your education—including relevant coursework, projects, and presentations—and using the two remaining pages to detail your work experiences, volunteering, student organizations, and other relevant experiences.</li>
                            <p>Federal hiring requires that your resume must explicitly reflect the minimum qualifications cited in the job posting. More information regarding resume best practices is available on <span class="tbd">Join TTS</span>.</p>

                            <li><strong>November – December: Resume review and take-home assignment</strong>
                            <p>The first three pages of your resume will first be reviewed by subject matter experts in the track you applied to. If your resume reflects the minimum qualifications for the position, you will receive a short take-home assignment to complete. <span class="tbd">[Link to Job Announcement]</span></p>
                            <p>The assignment will be track-specific and take no longer than two hours to complete. You will have one week to submit the assessment, which will also be reviewed by subject matter experts.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>December: Interview with a subject matter expert in your track</strong>
                            <p>If your take-home assignment meets the required competencies for your track, you will be invited to a 60-minute interview. You should expect your interview to cover both technical and non-technical (behavioral) questions. </p>
                            <p>All interviews will be conducted virtually. Live captioning and other accessibility assistance is available for all candidates. If you require accommodations at any point of the application or hiring process, please contact jointts@gsa.gov.</p>
                            <p>Preference will be applied to applicants who move forward after the phone interview stage.</p>

                            <p>Qualified candidates will have an opportunity to interview with U.S. Digital Corps host agencies and their project champions based on mutual interest and alignment of skill sets. Candidates at this stage will receive additional information about specific agency projects. </p>
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>February: Final selections and tentative offers.</strong>
                            <p>Upon consultation with host agencies, we will finalize agency placements and offers. As the Digital Corps operates within the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), the GSA HR team will make tentative offers to selected candidates. Tentative offers are contingent on passing a background check.</p>
                            <p>As your offer details will depend on your work location, we will work with you and your agency to determine your preferred work location subject to the position requirements and telework policies of your agency.</p>
                            <p>Our team will also set up calls for incoming Digital Corps Fellows to welcome you to the program and our community, and answer any questions.</p>

                            <li><strong>March – April: Pre-employment process</strong>
                            <p>Once you accept your tentative offer, you will receive an email from the HR onboarding system. You will need to login and accept your tentative offer. You will be asked to complete a series of forms and receive a USAaccess email requesting you to schedule a time to provide your fingerprints for your security clearance and complete an e-QIP security questionnaire.</p>
                            <p>Once your e-QIP has been initially cleared, you will receive an interim security clearance, and a GSA HR specialist will call you with a final offer. At this stage, GSA HR and the Digital Corps team will confirm your start date in June 2022.</p>
                            <p>Note: We do not recommend you give notice or resign from your current employer (if applicable) until you receive your final offer with a confirmed start date from HR.</p>

                            <li><strong>April – June 2022: Onboarding, orientation, and Fellow welcome!</strong>
                            <p>The exact start date for Fellows in June 2022 will be announced during the final selection process.</p>

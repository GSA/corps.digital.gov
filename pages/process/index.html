                                <p>We are recruiting Digital Corps Fellows in five skill tracks: software engineering, data science, product management, design, and cybersecurity.  <span class="tbd">[Link to The Opportunity page; section on tracks]</span></p>
                                <p>Apply for the track in which you have the most experience. It’s okay if you have experience or interest in more than one area, but we ask that you select the track that most closely matches your skill set. Doing so will help our team thoughtfully pair candidates with agencies and projects. Your track selection will not limit the projects you are considered for and Digital Corps Fellows will have ample opportunity to learn and grow in areas beyond their selected track.</p>
                                <p>You may apply for up to two specialty tracks. Candidates who apply to more than two tracks will only be considered in two tracks.</p>

                            <li>Review the minimum qualifications/required competencies/specialized experience in your track of choice. <span class="tbd">[Link to Apply page, tracks section]</span>
                                <p>Your resume must reflect either an advanced degree in a technology field or one cumulative year of experience in the minimum qualifications/required competencies/specialized experience specific to your track to be considered. This can include paid or unpaid volunteer experiences, internships, student organizations, and jobs.</p>
                            </li>

Subject matter experts will review the first three pages of your resume for the minimum qualifications/required competencies/specialized experience described above. We recommend using one page to detail your education—including relevant coursework, projects, and presentations—and using the two remaining pages to detail your work experiences, volunteering, student organizations, and other relevant experiences.
                            <p>Federal hiring requires that your resume must explicitly reflect the minimum qualifications cited in the job posting.

                                <p>Upon consultation with host agencies, we will finalize agency placements and offers. As the Digital Corps operates within the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), the GSA HR team will make tentative offers to selected candidates. Tentative offers are contingent on passing a background check.</p>
                                <p>As your offer details will depend on your work location, we will work with you and your agency to determine your preferred work location subject to the position requirements and telework policies of your agency.</p>
                                <p>Our team will also set up calls for incoming Digital Corps Fellows to welcome you to the program and our community, and answer any questions.</p>

                                <p>Once you accept your tentative offer, you will receive an email from the HR onboarding system. You will need to login and accept your tentative offer.

                                <p>Once your e-QIP has been initially cleared, you will receive an interim security clearance, and a GSA HR specialist will call you with a final offer.

                                <p>Note: We do not recommend you give notice or resign from your current employer (if applicable) until you receive your final offer with a confirmed start date from HR.</p>

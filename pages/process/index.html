                            <li><strong>Review our <a href="#eligibility">eligibility criteria</a>.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Select your track.</strong>
                                We are recruiting Digital Corps Fellows in <a href="../opportunity/#tracks">five skill tracks</a>: software engineering, data science, product management, design, and cybersecurity.
                                <p>Apply for the track in which you have the most experience. It’s okay if you have experience or interest in more than one area, but we recommend that you select the track that most closely matches your skill set. Doing so will help our team thoughtfully pair candidates with agencies and projects. Your track selection will not limit the projects you are considered for and Digital Corps Fellows will have ample opportunity to learn and grow in areas beyond their selected track.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare your resume and transcript.</strong>

                            <li><strong>Resume</strong>. Federal resumes look different than industry resumes. Create a multi-page resume that reflects the qualifications for your selected track, which will be posted as part of the job announcement on the Apply page. You are strongly encouraged to use language from the job announcement. Your resume must reflect either one cumulative year of experience related to the track you are applying to or an advanced degree in a technology field.
                            <p>
                                Subject matter experts will review up to three pages of your resume: one page regarding your education—including relevant coursework, projects, and presentations—and the first two pages detailing your paid and unpaid work experiences, volunteering, student organizations, and other relevant experiences. More information regarding resume best practices is available on <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://join.tts.gsa.gov/resume/">Join TTS</a>.

                        <p>Here are some suggestions for crafting a competitive Digital Corps application:</p>
                        <ul class="usa-list">
                        <li>Try to submit your application the day it opens, as applications in each track may close before the deadline. The application open date will be announced in advance so candidates have time to prepare their applications. Subscribe to our mailing list for updates.</li>
                        <li>Thoroughly review our website, FAQs, and the job announcements when they are posted before applying.</li>
                        <li>Refer to the federal resume resources on Join TTS when creating your resume. Some tips:
                            <ul class="usa-list">
                            <li>Don’t just include paid positions or expressly technical positions. We are interested in your ability to work with different groups, stakeholders, and contexts.</li>
                            <li>If you are qualifying using one cumulative year of experience (as opposed to an advanced degree in a technology field), note that this is equivalent to 52 weeks at 40 hours a week. For part-time positions, be sure to include the number of hours you worked each week (e.g. 10 hours/week).</li>
                            <li>You are encouraged to use phrasing directly from the job announcements, which will be posted on the Apply page before applications open.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <p>Apply for the track in which you have the most experience. It’s okay if you have experience or interest in more than one area, but we recommend that you select the track that most closely matches your skill set. Doing so will help our team thoughtfully pair candidates with agencies and projects. Your track selection will not limit the projects you are considered for and Digital Corps Fellows will have ample opportunity to learn and grow in areas beyond their selected track.</p>

                        <p>Here are some suggestions for crafting a competitive Digital Corps application:</p>
                        <ul class="usa-list">
                            <li><strong>Apply early, as applications in each track may close before the deadline.</strong></li>
                            <li>Thoroughly review our website and <a class="usa-link" href="../faq/">FAQs.</a></li>
                            <li>Be as descriptive and detailed as possible when creating your resume. Some tips:
                                <ul class="usa-list">
                                    <li>Use the entirety of the three pages (one for education and two for experience) that will be reviewed by subject matter experts. Your resume should reflect the <a class="usa-link" href="../opportunity/#tracks">specialized experience statement</a> in your track.</li>
                                    <li>If you include skills, tools, and technologies you have used, be sure to describe the context of how and why those skills were used in each experience—do not just list these in a separate section.</li>
                                    <li>Don’t just include paid positions or expressly technical positions. We are interested in your ability to work with different groups, stakeholders, and contexts.</li>
                                    <li>If you are qualifying using one cumulative year of experience (as opposed to an advanced degree in a technology field), note that this is equivalent to 52 weeks at 40 hours a week. For part-time positions, be sure to include the number of hours you worked each week (e.g. 10 hours/week).</li>
                                    <li>Refer to the resume resources on <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://join.tts.gsa.gov/resume/">Join TTS</a> when creating your resume.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                <p>Once you accept your tentative offer, you will receive an email from the HR onboarding system. You will need to login and accept your tentative offer. You will be asked to complete a series of forms and receive a USAaccess email requesting you to schedule a time to provide your fingerprints for your security clearance and complete an e&#8209;QIP security questionnaire.</p>
                                <p>Once your e&#8209;QIP has been initially cleared, you will receive an interim security clearance, and a GSA HR specialist will call you with a final offer. At this stage, GSA HR and the Digital Corps team will confirm your late June 2022 start date.</p>
                                <p><strong>Note</strong>: We do not recommend you give notice or resign from your current employer (if applicable) until you receive your final offer with a confirmed start date from HR.</p>

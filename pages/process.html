It’s okay if you have experience or interest in more than one area, but we recommend that you select the track that most closely matches your skill set. Doing so will help our team thoughtfully pair candidates with agencies and projects.

                                <p>Once you have verbally accepted your tentative offer, you will receive an email from GSA’s HR onboarding system. You will need to login and officially accept your tentative offer. You will be asked to complete a series of HR forms, schedule a fingerprinting appointment, and complete an eAPP security questionnaire. <strong>Please note that final offers are contingent on passing a background check.</strong></p>
                                <p>GSA HR will also send instructions for requesting an official final transcript from your school ahead of you receiving your final job offer.</p>
                                <p>Once you pass initial access and GSA HR receives your final transcript, your HR specialist will call you with a final offer. At this stage, GSA HR and the Digital Corps team will confirm your start date.</p>
                                <p><strong>Note:</strong> We do not recommend you give notice or resign from your current employer (if applicable) until you receive your final offer with a confirmed start date from HR.</p>
                                <p>During this time, the Digital Corps team will set up meet & greets for incoming Fellows to welcome you to the program and our community, and answer any questions.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>The U.S. Digital Corps (USDC) recruits recent graduates and emerging technologists skilled in fields like software engineering, data science & analytics, product management, design, and cybersecurity. Fellows join your team as early-career professionals dedicated to public service, building their skills and leadership capabilities in government.</p>

      <p><h2>Agency participation criteria </h2>
        Strong USDC agency project proposals demonstrate:
        <ul id="spacing">
          <li><strong>Impact-Driven Projects</strong>: Initiatives with potential for real-world impact, particularly those that are public-facing, AI-focused, or designated as High-Impact Service Providers (HISP) by OMB. </li>
          <li><strong>Hands-On Work</strong>: Projects should allow Fellows to actively contribute technical skills through designing, building, and problem-solving. Fellows learn and grow by engaging in real, impactful technical work.</li>
          <li><strong>Supportive and Digitally Mature Teams</strong>: Teams with strong digital maturity and structured support systems at both the leadership and program levels, ready to mentor and guide Fellows in a growth-oriented environment. </li>
          <li><strong>Commitment to Development</strong>: A focus on fostering hands-on learning and career growth, helping Fellows become the next generation of federal technologists.</li>
          <li><strong>Pathways to Conversion</strong>: Opportunities for Fellows to transition into agency roles after the program, continuing their public service journey within teams or projects where they have made impactful contributions.</li>
          <li><strong>Funding</strong>: Budget and resources to support the two-year program commitment for each Fellow, including mentorship and development opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

       <h2>Project Priorities </h2>
      <p>While USDC Fellows work across a range of government-wide priorities, successful proposals often include projects focused on:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Customer Experience</strong>: Improving public-facing services and ensuring access to government programs and resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital & Data Modernization</strong>: Modernizing technology infrastructures and leveraging data analytics to inform agency decisions and operational efficiencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: Enhancing agency resilience and protection against digital threats to safeguard critical information and public trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence & Emerging Technologies</strong>: Exploring responsible and ethical applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation to solve complex agency challenges, drive innovation, and improve mission outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>The USDC Partnership Process</h2>
      <p><strong style="color: #0b4778;">Talent and selection:</strong>  USDC conducts annual, nationwide recruitment to attract diverse, skilled candidates from top programs, veteran communities, and specialized training initiatives. Using a rigorous SME-QA process, we engage federal subject matter experts to perform skills-based assessments, ensuring Fellows are well-matched to agency needs. Agency partners participate in final selection to confirm alignment with project goals and team fit.</p>
      <p><strong style="color: #0b4778;">Interagency Agreements (IAA):</strong> Fellows are hired through GSA and assigned to agencies via an Interagency Agreement (IAA), spending 80-90% of their time on agency work, with the balance on cohort learning and development.</p>
      <p> <strong style="color: #0b4778;">Work location and telework:</strong> Fellows are assigned nationwide with remote and hybrid options, depending on the host agency’s requirements.</p>
      <p> <strong style="color: #0b4778;">Duration:</strong> The U.S. Digital Corps fellowship spans two years, providing early-career technologists with in-depth exposure to public service and mission-driven projects. Fellows are fully integrated into their host agency’s teams, contributing to high-impact work while developing their professional skills. A core goal of the program is for Fellows to convert to a federal role within their host agency upon successful completion, enabling them to continue serving in a capacity directly aligned with their fellowship experience.</p>
      <p> <strong style="color: #0b4778;">Timeline of major milestones:</strong> The next USDC cohort is targeted to start in August 2025. Key partnership steps include submitting a proposal, conducting a scoping call, participating in candidate interviews, and establishing the Interagency Agreement (IAA).</p>

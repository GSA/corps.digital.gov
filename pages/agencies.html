      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>The U.S. Digital Corps (USDC) recruits recent graduates specializing in software engineering, data science & analytics, product management, design, and cybersecurity. As recent graduates, Fellows bring expertise in the latest cutting edge technologies, methodologies, and best practices. USDC provides a dedicated learning and development program throughout the two year fellowship, ensuring Fellows have the technical and leadership skills needed to serve your team. USDC is designed to allow agencies to easily convert Fellows to permanent positions at the end of the fellowship, where Fellows can continue their public service journey within teams or projects where they have made impactful contributions.</p>

      <p><h2>Agency participation criteria </h2>
        Strong USDC agency project proposals demonstrate:
        <ul class="spacing">
          <li><strong>Impact-driven projects</strong>: Initiatives with potential for real-world impact, particularly those that are public-facing, AI-focused, or designated as High-Impact Service Providers (HISP) by OMB. </li>
          <li><strong>Hands-on work</strong>: Projects should allow Fellows to actively contribute technical skills through designing, building, and problem-solving. Fellows learn and grow by engaging in real, impactful technical work.</li>
          <li><strong>Supportive and digitally mature teams</strong>: Teams with strong digital maturity and structured support systems at both the leadership and program levels, ready to mentor and guide Fellows in a growth-oriented environment. </li>
          <li><strong>Commitment to development</strong>: A focus on fostering hands-on learning and career growth, helping Fellows become the next generation of federal technologists.</li>
          <li><strong>Funding</strong>: Budget and resources to support the two-year program commitment for each Fellow.</li>
        </ul>

       <h2>Project and impact areas</h2>
      <p>While USDC Fellows work across a range of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects">government-wide priorities</a>, successful proposals often include projects focused on:
        <ul class="spacing">
            <li><strong>Customer experience</strong>: Improving public-facing services and ensuring access to government programs and resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital & data modernization</strong>: Modernizing technology infrastructures and leveraging data analytics to inform agency decisions and operational efficiencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: Enhancing agency resilience and protection against digital threats to safeguard critical information and public trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong>: Exploring applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation to solve complex agency challenges, drive innovation, and improve mission outcomes.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>USDC partnership process</h2>
      <p><strong>Talent and selection:</strong>  USDC conducts annual, nationwide recruitment to attract diverse, skilled candidates from top programs, veteran communities, and specialized training initiatives. Using a rigorous SME-QA process, we engage federal subject matter experts to perform skills-based assessments, ensuring Fellows are well-matched to agency needs. Agency partners participate in final selection to confirm alignment with project goals and team fit.</p>
      <p><strong>Interagency agreements (IAA):</strong> Fellows are hired at GSA to GS-9/11/12 career ladder positions. Fellows provide technical services to agencies via interagency service agreements, spending 80-90% of their time on project work, with the balance on cohort learning and development. Our standard agreements are severable, reimbursable service agreements.</p>
      <p> <strong>Work location and telework:</strong> Fellows are assigned to projects nationwide with remote and hybrid options, depending on the partner agency’s requirements.</p>
      <p> <strong>Duration:</strong> The U.S. Digital Corps fellowship spans two years, providing early-career technologists with in-depth exposure to public service and mission-driven projects. Fellows are fully integrated into their host agency’s teams, contributing to high-impact work while developing their professional skills. A core goal of the program is for Fellows to convert to a federal role within their host agency upon successful completion, enabling them to continue serving in a capacity directly aligned with their fellowship experience.</p>
      <p> <strong>Timeline of major milestones:</strong> The next USDC cohort is targeted to start in August 2025. Key partnership steps include submitting a proposal, conducting a scoping call, participating in candidate interviews, and establishing the interagency agreement (IAA).</p>

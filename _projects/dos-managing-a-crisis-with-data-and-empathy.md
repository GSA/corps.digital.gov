## The challenge
Amid years of massive political suppression and imprisonment of hundreds of political rivals, activists, students, journalists, business, religious leaders, and members of civil society at large, on February 9, 2023, Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega suddenly announced the release of 222 political prisoners into U.S. custody.  At the time of release, Nicaragua stripped the parolees of their citizenship, rendering them stateless.  The State Department quickly mobilized a task force – Operation Welcome Nica – to accomplish three primary goals in response to this humanitarian crisis: 

<ol>
<li>Welcome the parolees to the U.S. with safety and dignity.</li>
<li>Fulfill immediate needs for medical care, legal counsel, and family reunification.</li>
<li>Secure their futures beyond the parolees’ 4-day stay with us here in the capitol area.</li>
</ol>

## The solution 
Working at the Center for Analytics, the U.S. Digital Corps fellows joined the task force in setting up and executing the data analytics component of the operation.  CfA had three main responsibilities: data intake, reporting, and active family reunification/non-governmental organization (NGO) matching:  
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data intake</strong> included creating an in-flight passenger intake form to help identify accessibility needs and contacts in the U.S. and collecting critical hotel and status reporting data. These datasets prioritized hotel team activities and ensured that parolees connected with family or received needed support.  We worked with the Crisis Management Strategy (CMS) office to automate data flow between Operations Center call activity and on-site parolee status information. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reporting</strong> encompassed producing daily reports for the Deputy Executive Secretary and the White House, creating data extracts for NGOs providing ongoing legal and psychological support to the parolees, and producing ad-hoc reports for the Operations Center, Hotel Liaison team and the Virginia state government.  We also ensured our reporting metrics provided detailed status updates on parolees throughout the process.</li>
    <li><strong>Family reunification and NGO Matching</strong> included developing family reunification reporting criteria, collecting data to track departures, and liaising with NGOs, the hotel team, and the Ops Center to ensure all parolees had ongoing support once the task force concluded. </li>
</ul>

## The Impact

Through resoundingly successful interagency and inter-bureau cooperation (amongst Department of State, Customs and Border Protection, US Agency for International Development, Health and Human Services, Executive Office of the President, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and Virginia state and local agencies,) <strong>we connected all 222 political prisoners with ongoing support from family, friends, or NGOs.</strong>

It is often lamented that the government moves slowly, but this experience shows how quickly we can move and how well we can all work together in a crisis. The humanity and empathy every task force volunteer demonstrated towards the parolees in this effort was essential to their journey to healing from the trauma of their imprisonment.

Some additional metrics:
<ul>
    <li>Over 350 U.S. government volunteers provided onsite support through the task force.</li>
    <li>662 calls were fielded or placed through the Ops Center for family reunification and support.</li>
    <li>171 parolees were provided with medical care.</li>
</ul>

      “[T]here are not that many moments when you can really say and see directly that something you have done has actually changed someone’s life, and changed it for the better.  There are usually too many points of connection along the way to really see it and really feel it, but the experience that each of you has had – in this instance, I hope really makes that connection, makes it powerful, and is something that you’ll take with you throughout your careers and throughout your lives no matter what you do going forward.  It’s simply the most powerful thing that we occasionally have an opportunity to do, and it really is worth reflecting on.”

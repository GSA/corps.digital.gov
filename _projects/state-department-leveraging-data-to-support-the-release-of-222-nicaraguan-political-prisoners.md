## The challenge
Amid almost 5 years of massive political suppression and imprisonment of hundreds of political rivals, activists, students, journalists, business and religious leaders, and members of civil society at large, on February 9, 2023, Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega suddenly announced the release of 222 political prisoners into U.S. custody. At the time of their release, the Nicaraguan government stripped the parolees of their citizenship, rendering them stateless. The State Department in partnership with Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Agency for International Development, Department of Health and Human Services, Executive Office of the President, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and Virginia state and local agencies, quickly mobilized a task force to accomplish three primary goals in response to this humanitarian crisis: 
1. Welcome the parolees to the United States safely and with dignity;
2. Fulfill parolees’ immediate needs for medical care, legal counsel, and family reunification;
3. Secure parolees’ futures beyond their immediate four-day stay in the Washington, D.C. area.

## The approach
Three U.S. Digital Corps Fellows joined the M/SS/CfA data task force to manage the data analytics component of the operation. The Fellows worked directly with the parolees following their arrival to the U.S., as well as in the State Department Operations Center—which serves as the Department’s communications and crisis management center, in three areas of focus:

* USDC Fellows contributed to the development of an **in-flight and on the ground passenger intake form** to identify parolees’ medical and accessibility needs, as well as pre-existing family and community relationships in the United States. By automating data flow between Operations Center call activity and on the ground data, Fellows helped parolees immediately get connected with family and friends.
* USDC Fellows also contributed to the **daily production of Secretary of State and White House operation reports** and ensured reporting metrics provided detailed status updates on parolees throughout the process. In addition, Fellows regularly provided data extracts for NGOs providing ongoing legal and psychological support to the parolees, and produced ad-hoc reports for the Operations Center, hotel liaison team, and the Virginia state government.  
* Last but not least, USDC Fellows were critical in **developing family reunification and community reintegration reporting criteria**, collecting data to track departures, and liaising with NGOs, the hotel team, and the Operations Center to ensure all parolees had ongoing support once the task force concluded.

In the next phase, the Fellows interviewed two groups of users affected by the Safety and Well Being Follow Up Call: leaders of home study and post-release services programs, who would implement the new process, and case aides, who currently conduct calls. After five hours of calls, the team was better able to empathize and understand the perspectives of the callers, sponsors, and children. They learned that one of the biggest challenges, for everyone involved, was limited availability of sponsors and children during business hours, when many are working or in school.

Finally, the Fellows conducted a process map and content audit of the existing universe of procedures, reports, proposals, and a motley of program questionnaires to learn best practices that shelters were already using in their SWB calls. They prepared a proposal of over 30 new plain language questions that incorporated three virtual check-ins at seven business days, 14 business days, and 30 business days after a child’s release to a sponsor. An expanded medical and mental health section would eliminate the need for redundant post-release COVID-19 check-ins. The proposal also included relevant pre-call information, standardized the post-call assessment and escalation process, and coordinated with partners such as the Department of Justice’s Executive Office of Immigration Review. 


## The impact 

By leveraging inter-bureau and interagency cooperation **all 222 political prisoners were connected with ongoing support from family, friends, and/or NGOs within six days of their release from prison**. 

It is often lamented that government moves slowly. However this experience showed how quickly government can move and how well diverse teams can work together in a crisis. The humanity and empathy every task force volunteer demonstrated towards the parolees in this effort was essential to their journey to healing from the trauma of their imprisonment.

Some additional metrics:
* Over 350 U.S. government volunteers provided onsite support through the task force.
* Over 650 calls were fielded or placed through the Operations Center for family reunification and support.
* Parolees’ place of initial settlement included 25 states and Costa Rica.


> *“[T]here are not that many moments when you can really say and see directly that something you have done has actually changed someone’s life and changed it for the better.  There are usually too many points of connection along the way to really see it and really feel it, but the experience that each of you has had – in this instance, I hope really makes that connection, makes it powerful, and is something that you’ll take with you throughout your careers and throughout your lives no matter what you do going forward.  It’s simply the most powerful thing that we occasionally have an opportunity to do, and it really is worth reflecting on.”*

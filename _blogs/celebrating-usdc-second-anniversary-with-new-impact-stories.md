Two years ago, on August 30, 2021, in partnership with the White House and other federal agencies, GSA [announced](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/biden-administration-launches-us-digital-corps-to-recruit-the-next-generation-of-technology-talent-to-federal-service-08302021) the U.S. Digital Corps (USDC)—the first early-career technology fellowship in the federal government.

In the last two years, USDC has hired close to [90 early-career technologists](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/fellows/) across two cohorts. Their skill sets range from data science and analytics and cybersecurity to software engineering, product management, and design. Our Fellows have played important roles on teams across [19 federal agencies](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/projects/) contributing to high-priority projects including improving the customer experience of government and modernizing our nation’s public health system.

Earlier this month, both cohorts came together for the first time in Washington, D.C. for a day of community-building and discussion. New 2023 Fellows heard stories of impact from Fellows in our first cohort, including Fellows at the  at the State Department’s Center for Analytics (pictured below).

Today, to mark our second anniversary, we are publishing our first agency impact story highlighting Fellows’ early contributions at the Administration for Children and Families, within the Office of Refugee Resettlement:
- [Improving post-release care to migrant children and sponsors: Standardizing the Safety and Wellbeing Follow Up Calls](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/projects/acf-iprc/)

Additionally, we have seen in the last two years the [importance of storytelling](https://www.performance.gov/blog/digital-corps-update/) and humanizing the work of public servants—both to recruit talent and share best practices across agencies. USDC has shared these reflections and learnings in many locations including Digital.gov, GSA.gov, and agency blogs. 

Today, all of these stories (and future stories) are accessible at [digitalcorps.gsa.gov/blog](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/blog) — a single place for potential candidates and federal colleagues to read more about the Digital Corps, including:
- [Reflections on a year in government from 11 U.S. Digital Corps fellows](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/blogs/reflections-on-a-year-in-government-from-11-us-digital-corps-fellows/)
- [HHS Open Data and InnovationX for Impact at the 2023 Health Datapalooza](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/blogs/hhs-open-data-and-innovationx-for-impact-at-the-2023-health-datapalooza/)
- [Making Impact at Scale: Software Engineering in the Federal Government](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/blogs/making-impact-at-scale-software-engineering-in-the-federal-government/)

As we mark the end of our second year and the beginning of year three, the USDC team continues to grow! We have active hiring processes for data science and product management supervisors and we’ll soon begin hiring for our next cohort of Fellows to start in the summer of 2024, along with a few other program office positions.

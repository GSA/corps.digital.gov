Three years ago, on August 30, 2021, GSA officially launched the U.S. Digital Corps as a two-year, paid fellowship program to provide a pathway for early-career technologists to apply their skills and expertise across the federal government.

Since our launch, USDC has:
- Hired more than 150 early-career technologists accross three cohorts;
- Supported high-impact projects at 25 agencies;
- Had 95% of graduating Fellows in our first cohort continue their careers in government post-USDC.

## [Jillian Gilburne]({{site.baseurl}}/fellows/jillian-gilburne/) – 2022 Fellow
*Design Researcher, Unaccompanied Children Bureau, Office of Refugee Resettlement, Administration of Children and Families*

As I was getting ready to graduate from college, I had a mentor tell me that the paths for early-career designers in government were basically non-existent and that my best bet was to take any job and push for design whenever I could. Faced with this bleak reality, I was fortunate to find a wonderful home doing design work for the Department of Veterans Affairs as a contractor but always found myself wishing I could support projects from the inside. Three years later, USDC opened a door for me that I didn't think existed. Through this program, I was able to become not only a designer in the federal government but also a member of a team of designers working to improve the federal government's ability to care for unaccompanied children who come across our borders. Without USDC, I would probably be yelling about usability testing and journey mapping into the void somewhere. I am so grateful for this program and the proverbial seat at the table it has created for me and all the other early-career technologists in my cohort and beyond.

Build your confidence and find your support system. Doing technology work in the government will make you question your sanity and your skills constantly. The people are great and the problems are important and rewarding, but the environment can be incredibly taxing both physically and emotionally. When faced with some of the most complex problems and some of the highest stakes, going in with a strong sense of self and a group of friends and mentors to back you up can make all the difference. 

## [Luke Neureiter]({{site.baseurl}}/fellows/luke-neureiter/) – 2023 Fellow
*Product manager supporting the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)*

The most meaningful component of the USDC experience so far has been my fellow Fellows! The community in the fellowship is one-of-a-kind. Both in DC and around the country, the fellowship has connected me with an incredible group of people doing incredible things. Whether it is collaborating on best practices, troubleshooting an interesting solution we are workshopping, or sharing the best tunes to listen to at work, the Fellows have been both an incredible professional resource and a wonderful community to be welcomed into.

**Do you have any advice for someone interested in a career in civic tech?**  
Don’t stop trying! It is very easy to be discouraged by rejection or something not working out. I was actually rejected the first time I applied for USDC and subsequently reapplied a year later. There is a growing list of organizations and ways to get into civic tech, and this community needs more people. If you have a passion for improving technology in government, there is definitely a place for you.

## [Nolan Harrington]({{site.baseurl}}/fellows/nolan-harrington/) – 2023 Fellow
*Designer supporting the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)*

It has been such a great opportunity to work on high-impact projects as an early-career designer. I'm always shocked by the willingness of government leaders to learn and bring in new ways of working. Being able to make digital services more enjoyable is a great way to spend your work week.

**Do you have any advice for someone interested in a career in civic tech?**  
The government is more modern than you think! I was surprised and excited by the existing technical sophistication of many agencies. Bring your enthusiasm for innovation, and there will surely be places to plug in and work on emerging technologies.

## [Shahida Lucky]({{site.baseurl}}/fellows/shahida-lucky/) – 2023 Fellow
*Cybersecurity specialist supporting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)*

The most meaningful part of my USDC experience has been the learning and growth opportunities. I'm learning a lot every day and making valuable contributions to the team, which feels fantastic. USDC has given me an opportunity that is aligned with my career development. I love the "learning by doing" approach of the program for fresh graduates with diverse backgrounds.

**Do you have any advice for someone interested in a career in civic tech?**  
USDC provides the right platform to launch a career in civic tech. The program has been designed to accommodate individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences, allowing us to seamlessly integrate and pursue our careers, regardless of age, career gaps, or study breaks.

## [Anusha Prasad]({{site.baseurl}}/fellows/anusha-prasad/) – 2024 Fellow
*Software engineer supporting the Department of State*

As a USDC Fellow, I am most excited to learn more about how tech functions in the government. I have worked in the private sector, but I think I am ready to explore the public sector. I am excited to start being able to make a positive impact, and contribute meaningfully to bringing about social change with innovative technology. I think USDC is a great program for providing a pathway for early-career talent to do so. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity, and look forward to seeing where it leads!

**Do you have any advice for someone interested in a career in civic tech?**  
If you want to bring about more impactful change through tech, joining these (i.e. USDC) pathway programs are the best place to start. It can be daunting to join the government or public sector, but I think finding pathway programs is a great way to get your foot in the door. Don’t be afraid to start, because it’s never too late to make a positive change whether you are a new graduate or are switching careers!

## [Tyler Celestin]({{site.baseurl}}/fellows/tyler-celestin/)– 2024 Fellow
*Software engineer supporting the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)*

Being a USDC Fellow represents the first opportunity for me to work on enterprise production-grade software and tackle complex challenges in the public-facing realm. Though my first few days at my agency have not involved direct coding, the experience has nonetheless exposed me to a breadth of technologies and in-progress projects. I look forward to hitting the ground quickly when I am able to pick up my first ticket, providing impact in order to drive end-user satisfaction, iterating on best practices, and driving innovation whenever possible.

**Do you have any advice for someone interested in a career in civic tech?**  
From what I have experienced so far, working in civic tech is a fantastic opportunity with its own set of unique wrinkles, but I believe that those interested in working on projects with direct use cases and positive externalities should jump at the chance to be in a program like USDC. Most importantly, those who don't have a conventional path (like a computer science or data science education or a plethora of full time roles in product management) should also be eager as different perspectives and backgrounds are welcomed. Many of the leaders at my agency have non-conventional paths and have provided critical impact.

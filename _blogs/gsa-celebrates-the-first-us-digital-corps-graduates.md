**WASHINGTON** —  Today, GSA is celebrating the graduation of the inaugural class of U.S. Digital Corps (USDC) fellows with a ceremonial event at GSA headquarters. The graduation marks a major milestone in the success of the U.S. Digital Corps serving as the government’s pipeline for early-career technologists. Of its 2022 cohort, USDC had a two-year retention rate of 97%, and 95% of graduates are planning to stay on in career civil service positions at 15 federal agencies.

“What was once just an idea is now a rapidly-scaling and impactful program serving agencies government-wide,” said **GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan**. “Together, this USDC cohort has built 21st century digital infrastructure that will enable the government to deliver more effectively for millions of Americans.”

USDC launched in August 2021 as a cross-government effort between the General Services Administration, the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Personnel Management, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to close the early‑career technology talent gap. Since then USDC has recruited more than 80 fellows supporting 19 federal agencies.

The inaugural cohort, which kicked off in June 2022, is now graduating the program after 2 years serving as software engineers, product managers, data scientists, designers, and cybersecurity experts. 

Fellows contributed to high-impact technological efforts across the federal government by supporting [Long COVID research](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/projects/hhs-enhancing-health-equity-by-bringing-the-experiences-of-people-with-long-covid/), [improving access](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/projects/cms-designing-a-how-to-guide-for-improving-access-to-behavioral-health-care-and-support/) to behavioral healthcare and support through FindSupport.gov, and [implementing cybersecurity practices](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/projects/state-evaluating-emerging-technologies-and-global-cyber-posture-at-the-department-of-state/) to ensure U.S. diplomats can conduct official business securely and effectively. Over the two years, fellows worked at 14 agencies across the federal government. 

“Working with the U.S. Digital Corps fellows has been transformative for our projects and initiatives,” said **Director of Digital Service at the Administration for Children and Families Sarah Tully**. “Their enthusiasm, innovation, and commitment to excellence have made a significant impact on our mission. We are excited to welcome them as full-time team members and look forward to the continued collaboration with future cohorts of USDC fellows.”

“The U.S. Digital Corps was a perfect launchpad into public service for me. It helped me find a meaningful role that bridged both my undergraduate majors in computer science and international relations, allowing me to contribute to developing data-informed policy,” said **2022 U.S. Digital Corps Fellow Ashwini Shankar**, now working as a data scientist at the U.S. Department of State Center for Analytics. “USDC has also given me a community of peers that I will stay close to for years to come.”

USDC is preparing to welcome its third cohort of fellows in August. The third cohort will see an increase of fellows, including 50 AI and AI-enabling fellows hired in support of the [AI Talent Surge](https://ai.gov/apply/).

“I want to congratulate the graduating fellows and everyone across government who made the U.S. Digital Corps such a success in its first two years,” said **Federal Chief Information Officer Clare Martorana**. “Technology underpins our ability to deliver secure government services to the American people -- and the USDC tech talent pipeline will help us move faster in driving the progress we know is possible.”

By empowering the next generation of technology leaders to launch careers in public service, USDC aims to create a government technology workforce that reflects all Americans and enables agencies to deliver better government experiences to the public.

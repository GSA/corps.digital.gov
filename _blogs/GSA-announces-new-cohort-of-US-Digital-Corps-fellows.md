**WASHINGTON** —  Today, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) welcomed [70 new fellows](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/fellows/2024/#fellows-select-year) to the U.S. Digital Corps (USDC), a fellowship that provides a pathway for early-career technologists to apply their skills and expertise in the federal workplace. 

More than 2,000 applications were submitted during the recruitment cycle, the largest number the program has received. The 2024 Fellows are USDC’s third cohort, which includes individuals who will focus on AI and AI-related projects in response to the [National AI Talent Surge](https://ai.gov/apply/). 

“Growing the U.S. Digital Corps is crucial to driving innovation across the federal government, especially as emerging technologies like AI evolve,” said **GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan**. “GSA is focused on delivering great value to our customer agencies and the American people, so we are proud to help lead the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to bring tech talent into government to deliver those results.”

USDC is a two‑year paid fellowship that offers five tracks: cybersecurity, data science and analytics, design, product management, and software engineering. Fellows will support projects at 19 federal agencies – six of which will be new agency partners to USDC, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Fellows will support and advance a variety of high-priority technology initiatives for example:

- Improving cybersecurity, border security, airport security, disaster recovery areas, drug capture, and security at sea by leveraging artificial intelligence systems to advance the Department of Homeland Security mission. 
- Applying qualitative and quantitative research and analytics to improve consular service design at the Department of State, including passport and visa services, to deliver for the tens of millions of U.S. citizens and foreign nationals who depend on them.
- Helping the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) support disaster survivors by making the process to apply and receive disaster support more streamlined, accessible, and equitable.

“I believe strongly in the contract between the American people and our government; that the federal government has a duty to provide adequate services, support, and aid to all, especially our most vulnerable,” said **Zach Palmer, a 2024 USDC Data Science and Analytics Fellow**. “With these beliefs in mind, I felt that the U.S. Digital Corps was the perfect place for me to leverage my technical skills to help the federal government effectively serve its constituents, while also giving me the opportunity to mentor under incredibly talented and knowledgeable public servants.”

Since its inception in 2021, USDC has recruited more than 150 early-career technologists and has supported projects of national significance at 25 agencies. Of the graduates in USDC’s inaugural 2022 cohort, [ninety-five percent](https://www.gsa.gov/node/164779) chose to remain with the federal government post-fellowship and continue their service to the American people.
